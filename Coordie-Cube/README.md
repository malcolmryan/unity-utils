# Coordie The Co-ordinate Cube

A bare-bones Blender file containing a coordinate frame cube with an X, Y and Z axis, for whenever you might need that kind of thing. Also contains a Unity project with some basic scripting.

## Blender file
The blender file is just an object with a sphere representing the point of the coordinate frame, a cube, and three axis arrows pointing in their respecitive directions. Colours are used to indicate direction.

The blender file is within the Unity project.

## Unity project
A very basic Unity project that contains the cube and a grid plane. A script is applied to the coordinate cube to stop the point sphere and axis arrows from warping when things are resized (works in play mode only).

## What do I do with this?
Whatever you want! I made this for fun and also because I thought it might be helpful when teaching my students about coordinates frames, vectors and points. Use it in your teaching, your projects, and more! Please let me know if it helped you.
